# Visualizing the Diamonds Data Set in R

## Overview

This brief project revisits a past assignment in the Harris course "Data & Programming in R I" taught by Dr. Peter Ganong. This problem set focused on data visualization, specifically in creating complex, informative graphs for the built-in diamonds data set from the package `ggplot2` (part of `tidyverse`).
