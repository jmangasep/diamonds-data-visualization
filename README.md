# Visualizing the Diamonds Data Set in R

This brief project revisits a past assignment in the Harris course "Data & Programming in R I" taught by Dr. Peter Ganong. This problem set focused on data visualization, specifically in creating complex, informative graphs for the built-in diamonds data set from the package `ggplot2` (part of `tidyverse`). 

Using the problem set as a guide, I visualized the variation within diamonds' prices and carats, and I did the same for the covariation between the cut of a diamond and several numeric diamond variables (e.g. carat, length, width, and depth). The file aims to demonstrate my ability to create visually appealing and understandable graphs for academic and non-academic audiences.
